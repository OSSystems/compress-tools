# compress-tools

The `compress-tools` crate aims to provide a convenient and easy to use set
of methods which builds on top of `libarchive` exposing a small set of itâ€™s
functionalities.

## Dependencies

You must have `libarchive` properly installed on your system in order to use
this. If building on *nix systems, `pkg-config` is used to locate the
`libarchive`; on Windows `vcpkg` will be used to locating the `libarchive`.

The minimum supported Rust version is 1.40.

## Features

This crate is capable of extracting:

* compressed files
* archive files
* single file from an archive

For example, to extract an archive file it is as simple as:

```rust
use compress_tools::*;
use std::fs::File;
use std::path::Path;

let mut source = File::open("tree.tar.gz")?;
let dest = Path::new("/tmp/dest");

uncompress_archive(&mut source, &dest, Ownership::Preserve)?;
```

Also, this crate can be used in async code. It requires to enable the `async` feature.

As an example, this code extracts file into Vec from an archive in async environment:
```rust

use compress_tools::asynchronous::*;
use tokio::fs::File;

let mut source = File::open("test.tar.gz").await?;
let mut target = Vec::default();

uncompress_archive_file(&mut source, &mut target, "test.txt").await?;
```
