# compress-tools

The `compress-tools` crate aims to provide a convenient and easy to use set
of methods which builds on top of `libarchive` exposing a small set of itâ€™s
functionalities.

This crate is capable of extracting:

* compressed files
* archive files
* single file from an archive

For example, to extract an archive file it is as simple as:

```rust
use compress_tools::*;
use std::fs::File;
use std::path::Path;

let mut source = File::open("tree.tar.gz")?;
let dest = Path::new("/tmp/dest");

uncompress_archive(&mut source, &dest)?;
```
